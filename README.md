This project applies cosine similarity to evaluate relationships within datasets, utilizing Python for data manipulation. Key libraries include pandas for data processing, numpy for calculations, and scikit-learn for computing cosine similarity, which helps uncover patterns and similarities between data points.

Data Preprocessing: The project addresses missing values, normalizes data, and applies feature scaling using pandas and numpy. These steps ensure the dataset is clean and ready for analysis, allowing for accurate similarity calculations.

Visualization: With the help of matplotlib and seaborn, the project visualizes data distributions, correlations, and cosine similarity matrices. These visual tools make it easier to interpret the results and uncover relationships between data features.

Python Script for Automation: The app.py script automates the cosine similarity analysis for larger datasets, enabling you to perform the analysis outside a Jupyter environment for efficient batch processing.

Jupyter Notebook for Interactive Analysis: A Jupyter Notebook is included to provide an interactive walkthrough. It guides you through loading, preprocessing, visualizing the data, and calculating cosine similarity between data vectors or features.

Usage: Run app.py to execute the cosine similarity analysis automatically.
Explore the dataset and perform similarity analysis interactively using the Jupyter Notebook.

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
